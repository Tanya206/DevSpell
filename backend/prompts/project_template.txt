Create a complete project implementation based on the following specifications:

Project Requirements:
{prompt}

Technical Stack:
- Frontend: {frontend_option}
- Backend: {backend_option}
- Database: {database_option}

Generate the following:
1. Complete project structure with all necessary files
2. Implementation code for each file
3. Configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
4. README.md with setup and running instructions
5. GitHub Actions workflow for testing
6. Database schema and migrations
7. API documentation
8. Environment variables template

Format the response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "files": [
        {
            "path": "relative/path/to/file",
            "content": "file content",
            "description": "brief description of the file's purpose"
        }
    ],
    "setup_guide": "detailed setup instructions",
    "github_actions": "workflow yaml content"
}

Ensure all code is production-ready and follows modern development standards.
